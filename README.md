This is a supplementary package to [Covid19CanadaData](https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19CanadaData) used to process the ingested data into a common format.

`Covid19CanadaDataProcess` is part of [`Covid19CanadaETL`](https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19CanadaETL), which is used to assemble the [`Covid19Canada`](https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada) dataset from the [COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group](https://opencovid.ca/). It is also used in the [Timeline of COVID-19 in Canada](https://github.com/ccodwg/CovidTimelineCanada), one component of the **[What Happened? COVID-19 in Canada](https://whathappened.coronavirus.icu/)** project.
